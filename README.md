# Dresser

A [Dalamud](https://discord.gg/3NMcUV5) plugin aiming to ease glamour dresser experience.


This plugin is still under development, there are a lot of things to improve.
WARNING: this plugin may be resources hungry as it attempts to recreate original item's slots style visuals.

Sorry for the dirty coding. I'm just a mediocre dev with ideas but no RE capacities.

TODO:
Optimize image memory or make image-less option.

Planned features:

1. glam anywhere
    - offer to apply pending changes when opening dresser with pending changes
       - tell what to get from other inventories/vendor before applying
       - display that ^ as a nice list of items and dyes
       - after it's applied and it differs from pending plates, ask if they want to reload actual plates into pending plates

2. current appearance
    - load current plate appearance on enter
    - vanilla buttons for current appearance show/hide weapons/helmet/visor also affect current appearance
    - show what gearsets are linked to this glam plate

3. current gear window
    - add controls:
       - visibility
    - displays greyed out when selecting an items that isn't in dresser/armoire

    - show tasks to do
      - get dyes
      - buy from vendor
      - take item from x inventory and put it in glamour chest
      - select plate x and apply changes

4. Gear Browser window
    - fuzzy search (split sentances with && contains words ignorecase)

5. Item Icons
    - more keyboard shortcuts

          - open gamer escape
          - open garland tools

6. Camera placement

7. keep track of everything
